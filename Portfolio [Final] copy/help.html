    <p class="info">The tn means number of terms that you want to find. The t1 refers to the term 1 that the sequence
        starts with. The 'd' value is the common difference that we get by subtracting t2 - t1.</p>

    <p class="info">The tn means number of terms that you want to find. The t1 refers to the term 1 that the sequence
        starts with. The 'r' value is the common ratio which we get by dividing the t2 - t1.</p>
